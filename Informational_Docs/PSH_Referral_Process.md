\[Vibrant PBS8 Referral/Intake Process]{.underline}



Vibrant has 40 Project-based Section 8 (PBS8) units.



\-   20 are Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) units that are case

&nbsp;   managed by JOIN's mobile PSH (MPSH) housing team



\-   20 are Homeless Preference units that are supported/case managed by

&nbsp;   IHI's Housing Stability Specialist (Kody Barnett)



```{=html}

<!-- -->

```

\-   When a PBS8 unit (PSH or HP) becomes available (either through

&nbsp;   notice or actual vacancy), the Vibrant Manager should send an email

&nbsp;   to the Family Coordinated Access system at the Joint Office of

&nbsp;   Homeless Services (JOHS). The email address to request referrals is

&nbsp;   <familyca@multco.us>.



\-   \[IPM property manager will add the referral request (including unit

&nbsp;   number and date requested) to the PBS8 google tracking

&nbsp;   sheet.]{.mark}



> Within 3 weeks someone at JOHS will respond with a referral for the

> unit. \[JOHS will include IHI's Housing Stability Specialist on HP

> referrals so he can support applicants through the paperwork

> process.]{.mark} (3 weeks)

>

> \[If JOHS does not send referrals for vacant units within 3 weeks, the

> Vibrant Manager may pull applicants off of the building's Section 8

> waitlist. In that case, the unit may not house a PSH household until

> it turns over, at which point the Vibrant Manager will once again

> request a referral from Family Coordinated Access/JOHS.]{.mark}



\-   Once a referral is made, the Vibrant Manager will begin the LIHTC

&nbsp;   screening and application process. \*\\\* Applicant and their

&nbsp;   supporting team should start working on gathering all vital

&nbsp;   documents including SS cards, paystubs, etc.\*



```{=html}

<!-- -->

```

\-   Applicants may be supported through this process by JOHS/Family CA

&nbsp;   staff as well as the HSS.



\-   If a PSH referral, JOIN's MPSH team may also provide support.



\-   The Vibrant Manager will update the JOHS/IPM google tracking sheet

&nbsp;   with applicant name and keep the tracking sheet updated so everyone

&nbsp;   can track progress.



\-   Screening - a background check should be completed within a week. (1

&nbsp;   week)



```{=html}

<!-- -->

```

\-   If applicant is denied based on screening criteria, they may appeal

&nbsp;   or request a reasonable accommodation.



\-   \*\*NOTE:\*\* If an applicant knows that they will not pass screening

&nbsp;   criteria, it is highly recommended that they provide appeal

&nbsp;   documents with their application.



&nbsp;   -   Appeals/RA requests are decided by Compliance Department --

&nbsp;       these decisions will be made within 7-10 business days.

&nbsp;       \*\\\*Longer if legal input is needed\\\*\*



\-   If an appeal is submitted within 10 business days of a denial, the

&nbsp;   unit will be held pending the appeal. If the appeal is not submitted

&nbsp;   within 10 business days, the Vibrant Manager will submit another

&nbsp;   referral request to <familyca@multco.us>.



\-   If an applicant fails to show/complete paperwork or is denied and

&nbsp;   the appeal is not approved the Vibrant Manager will update the

&nbsp;   tracker and inform JOHS/request a replacement referral.



> LIHTC paperwork -- this can be done as quickly as a week, but

> applicants typically need more time to produce required documents.

> They will have five days to respond following each request for

> information. IPM's compliance department will review and provide final

> approval of any income certifications. (3 weeks)



\-   Once an applicant passes screening and is income certified with

&nbsp;   onsite compliance, the Vibrant Manager sends an intake request to HF

&nbsp;   with an ROI, pre-application, final accounting from last resident,

&nbsp;   and a Home Forward referral.



&nbsp;   -   Home Forward does their own background/screening. (2 weeks)



&nbsp;   -   Home Forward passes/denies/or makes changes at this point. Home

&nbsp;       Forward works with the applicants to gather information. When

&nbsp;       they pass an intake packet is sent to the Vibrant Manager.



&nbsp;   -   The Vibrant Manager receives the intake packet and calls

&nbsp;       applicant to schedule an appointment to complete the intake

&nbsp;       packet.



&nbsp;   -   \*\[The Vibrant Manager and IHI's HSS (if an HP unit) will assist

&nbsp;       the applicant household with this intake packet.]{.mark}\*



&nbsp;   -   \[IPM compliance reviews the completed intake packet for accuracy

&nbsp;       and completion.]{.mark}



&nbsp;   -   \[The Vibrant Manager then sends the completed intake packet to

&nbsp;       HF.]{.mark}



&nbsp;   -   Once approved, the intake packet is sent back to Home Forward.



&nbsp;       -   This is when all the vitals -SS cards, birth certificates,

&nbsp;           > ID, etc... are needed to be included with the intake

&nbsp;           > packet.



&nbsp;   -   Applicant waits for Home Forward to reach out and schedule an

&nbsp;       intake appointment (2-3 weeks)



&nbsp;       -   During this time or sooner the manager schedules the unit

&nbsp;           > for an inspection. The inspection is good for 60 days



&nbsp;       ```{=html}

&nbsp;       <!-- -->

&nbsp;       ```

&nbsp;       -   The Vibrant Manager waits 3 weeks and then checks in with HF

&nbsp;           > every week until a decision is made.



&nbsp;   -   Home Forward completes the intake appointment. A contract is

&nbsp;       emailed to the Vibrant Manager within a week.



\-   Once approved by HF, the Vibrant Manager will schedule a move-in



&nbsp;   -   The Vibrant Manager will communicate move-in dates to JOIN's

&nbsp;       MPSH team if a PSH unit, or to IHI's Housing Stability

&nbsp;       Specialist (and provide a TIC) if an HP unit.



&nbsp;   -   Once the applicant has moved in: the Vibrant Manager will send

&nbsp;       an email confirming the move in, and any documents that are

&nbsp;       required to the referring parties.
